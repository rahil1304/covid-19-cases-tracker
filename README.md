Coronavirus has impacted all of us and definitely changed our lives. Even though few countries have eased their restrictions, many are yet quarantined at their homes. With the astonishing number of cases at a rise both Globally and in India, I decided to create a project on coronavirus which would help us track the daily cases globally and give us a country-wise split of cases with graphs for visual aid.
I developed a fully responsive Covid-19 Tracker Website. This website keeps track of the total cases, recovered cases, and deaths globally and country-wise in real-time. It further displays the data in a graphical format.
Moreover, with the rising demand for dark-mode in various applications, I decided to add a toggle button to change the display mode according to user preference.
The project is live and running on the following link

To run the project locally, clone the repository and run the following command to install the dependencies.

### `yarn install`
